The roof is steeply pitched with smooth sweeping lines like that of elven lands. The glass windows are perfectly clear, unlike your own, which are dotted with imperfection and have a constant haze that makes gazing out of them a dizzying experience. You approach the front door, it is bright red with a large brass knocker.\n\nWhat do you do?",
